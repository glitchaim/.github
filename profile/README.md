## üëã  About Us
Glitch Aim is a PvP Server that was launched on 13 May 2021 for the FiveM community.It is based on true custom-framework glitch made by [TGB](https://github.com/techygamebar/).
With every escalation there is a downfall with time,many people tried to become obstacle between running the server hence got closed for sometime,but in Glitch Aim I prioritise what players want to say, Here we are with another try to continue the Legacy Of Glitch Aim 
working on scripts for the server to get a fresh new start by doing it from scratch again. BUT THIS TIME I HAVE AND GOING TO PUT MY WHOLE SOLE EFFORTS AND THY SHOULD NOT GO IN VAIN.
